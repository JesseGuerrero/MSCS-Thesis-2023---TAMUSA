Within the text analysis and processing fields, generated text attacks have been made easier to create
than ever before. To combat these attacks open sourcing models and datasets have become a major
trend to create automated detection algorithms in defense of authenticity. For this purpose, synthetic

purpose of creating a snapshot of the state of current literature and easing the barrier to entry for
future authors. Towards that goal, we identified research trends and challenges in this field,
